 SMTP-mail-sender-using-python :
 
 This project uses SMTP library from python to send emails from your Python console or IDE.
 The project also includes attaching images or text files as attachments to the email.
 
 The Google.txt and unnamed.png are simply dummy inputs, you can feed in your own files and
 make slight changes in the code (with respect to file name) and your code is good to go .
 
 Before sending the email make sure you have allowed "Less secure app access" to use your
 gmail id, failing in which it throws an error:
 " SMTPAuthenticationError: (535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at\n5.7.8 https://support.google.com/mail/?p=BadCredentials h10sm5461249pgn.11 - gsmtp') "
 
 The same eror is also thrown when you enter wrong credentials .
